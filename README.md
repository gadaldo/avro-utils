Avro Util
---

This simple maven project is a utility project to build Avro schema from an Google Bigquery table.
In Google Cloud Platform there is no such utility so this would help in case you need.

version: _DRAFT_


Seen this has been tested on some internal Google Bigquery tables, 
any review, bug or feedback is welcome so please contribute to it writing here.
